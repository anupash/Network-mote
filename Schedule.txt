Week 1 and 2:
- Get familiarized with provided code
- Make code run on motes

Week 3:
- Aded routing support.
All nodes keep a routing table, that they check when they want to forward a packet to a node, which can be a client or the gateway. This table contains an entry for each node in the netwrok, where the next hop (next mote) to reach that node is stored.
This allows a sensor network to be built, and clients that cannot reach the gateway directly can still do it through intermediary nodes.

- Routing working. Tried it by limiting by code for each node, from whum they process the routing updates. This way we ensurte a certain topology were we can test if the packet hop works correctly.
- Moving to roaming
